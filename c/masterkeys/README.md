# Cooler Master MasterKeys
Here are some small projects written with [MasterKeys SDK](https://makerhub.coolermaster.com/custom-lighting/).

Due to complications with the build process I've built inside WSL using the mingw cross compiler so the same makefile should work in Linux provided you have that tool installed.

For VS Code there is this extension: [ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) (`vscode:` protocol link)
