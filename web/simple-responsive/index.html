                <p>Here’s some paragraph text. It’s pretty cool. When you span it onto many lines it’ll justify those lines which is quite cool so this is why I’m writing such long lines.</p>
                <p>Here’s some more paragraph text, as you can see it’s cool and aligned in such a way that it’s cool and pretty cool and it’s just cool in general. I like this a lot man it's pretty cool.</p>

                <p>Here’s some paragraph text. It’s pretty cool, yo. When you span it onto many lines it’ll justify those lines which is quite cool so this is why I’m writing such long lines.</p>

                <h1>Optimized for scanning</h1>
                <p>The lines in this text are 55 characters wide, so they are in the optimal range for ease of scanning. Most books use a similar line width. Everything is also <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5ch; font-variant-ligatures: none"><em>justified</em></span> so that our eyes can find the start and end of each line quickly. I even spaced out the lines a little, because damn the default is hard to read.</p>
                <aside><strong>Note:</strong> 55 characters isn’t the objective optimum. Different people will probably have different preferences, but this is based on my opinion alone.</aside>

                <h1>‘Unicode’ vs. 'ASCII'</h1>
                <p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>. What’s more we don’t fuss with those HTML entities like some <code>&amp;rsquo;</code> nonsense either (except that &amp;, which we can’t avoid). Just gotta make sure we include the charset declaration, or our page gets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">mojibake</a>’d:
                <pre><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code></pre></p>
                <p>I considered fixing a justification style, like the <code>inter-word</code> or <code>inter-character</code> values for the CSS3 property <code>text-justify</code>. In the end, I decided that in general justifi­cation should be kept to a minimum by using short words and offering hyphen­ation for longer ones. For example, in the previous paragraph I moved the inline HTML code to its own line to avoid overjustification.</p>
                <p>We can even use some weird symbols like kg⋅ms<sup>-1</sup>, or use lots of weird spaces like kg ms<sup>-1</sup> (<a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/202F/">U+202F Narrow No-Break Space</a>). We can really fine-tweak and leverage the typographic design that goes into our font.</p>
                <p>I could have gone even further in this department and used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature"><dfn>ligatures</dfn></a>, which are joined (usually pairs of) letters, but the returns are much diminishing. There used to be some ligatures quoted inline here, but including them causes the browser to download another font file, and that’s just no good.</p>

                <h1>HTML5 goodness</h1>
                <p>We can have a lot of cool stuff in this document, like a definition list:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><dfn title="HyperText Markup Language 5">HTML5</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>The markup language with which this page was written.</dd>
                    <dt><dfn title="Cascading Style Sheets 3">CSS3</dfn></dt>
                    <dd>The stylesheet language used to make this page look pretty.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>This list uses the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp">HTML5 definition list</a> tags, along with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dfn.asp"><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag</a>, to create an accessible list of definitions for the confused.</p>
                <p>We have a few HTML5-based options to optimise the readability of our text even more. We have the <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> element, which can equally be replaced by <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00ad/index.htm">U+00AD Soft Hyphen</a>, and gives the layout engine an opportunity to break a long word like <em>pneumono­ultra­micro­scopic­silico­volcano­coniosis</em> if it suits the word wrapping better.</p>
